### Summary

Our goal with this project is to use new technologies along with React-Native to get an app on the AppStore.

### Application Functionality

The cross-platform (iOS & Android) mobile Gratitude application will allow users, when authenticated, to create Gratitudes and to perform CRUD actions (update and delete) on those Gratitudes.

### User Interface Requirements (MVP)

- [ ] Authentication flow
- [ ] Login/ Signup screens
- [ ] Verification Code screen (after sign up)
- [ ] Gratitudes List Screen - List out Gratitudes in a FlatList
- [ ] Gratitude Creation

### Stretch Requirements

- [ ] Users can start/maintain a streak by submitting one or more gratitudes on adjacent days
- [ ] User's streak is displayed in header
- [ ] Profile Screen
- [ ] Gratitude Edit (re-use Creation UI?)
- [ ] Users have the option to save gratitude privately or share publically
- [ ] All publicly shared gratitudes are pinned on a public map that all users can view

### Frontend Technology Requirements

- State management: MST - Use Mobxâ€™s design patterns for accessing/mutating app state (\*\* check out flow (generator) functions for asynchronous model actions)
  https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx-state-tree
- Navigation: React Navigation
  https://github.com/react-navigation/react-navigation
- Authentication: Amplify JS client library (link up with Cognito)
  https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/js/authentication
- UI Framework: NativeBase (if necessary)
  https://nativebase.io

### Backend Technology Requirements

- [ ] Authentication: AWS Cognito
      https://aws.amazon.com/cognito/
- [ ] Database: AWS AppSync + Dynamo database
      https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/
      https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/
